## About the project

prologe.press is a platform that helps fund crypto content. The platform that allows people to post bounties for crypto content. The community decides which articles should be written by creating and/or sponsoring content bounties. Writers compete for the votes of the bounty sponsors to get their share of the bounty.

## Where are we today

At this moment, the project is in a prototype state. We've selected and financed a few topics ourselves and created them as bounties. To get the ball rolling. You can find them [here](https://prologe.press). Right now, everything is centralized and [discord](https://discord.gg/RQqSMu5jhU) is used to discuss, vote and create bounties.

You can participate in the community by joining our [discord](https://discord.gg/RQqSMu5jhU).

## Where do we want to go

We're working hard on creating smart contracts to decentralize the bounties. We're aiming at the beginning of October to deploy these smart contracts.
